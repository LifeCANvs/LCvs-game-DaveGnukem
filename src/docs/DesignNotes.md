# Source Code Design Notes

Source files starting with "dj" are intended to indicate code that is part of the potentially re-usable parts of the codebase, that could potentially be re-used for other games or applications (one could think of these parts almost as a library or mini- basic engine/framework), for example djimage.h/cpp is design-wise general, not game-specific, and potentially re-usable.

(Although the code doesn't currently 100% neatly stick to this due its long and winding history and origins, that's one of the design intentions and directions/goals.)
